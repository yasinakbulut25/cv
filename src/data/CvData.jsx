    title: "About",
    text: `
    I worked as a UI Developer at Jotform, a platform serving over 25 million users. 
    Within the Product team, I contributed to the development and deployment of key features such as Push Notification, 
    Copilot, and User Management for the No Code App Builder. I was also involved in the Jotform AI Agents product, 
    where I created dynamic email templates.
    <br/> <br/>
    I collaborated cross-functionally with designers to deliver intuitive, scalable, and maintainable frontend 
    interfaces using React, Redux, Styled Components, and SCSS.
    <br/> <br/>
    Outside of my professional role, I built and deployed personal web projects that generate passive income 
    and strengthened my skills in end-to-end, scalable web development.
    <br/> <br/>
    I am currently seeking new opportunities to apply my frontend expertise, 
    grow further, and contribute to impactful digital products.
